    "\n",
    "The context of this project is a boutique real estate firm opening in King County Washington, seeking to make a move into the market by gaining increasing their consumers. In order to do this, they've tasked their data scientists with creating a model which will predict the estimated housing price for potential clients. The desired output of this project is a simplified system which the UX team can implement on their website that will allow users to input a limited amount of known factors about their home, and output an estimated price range. They're hoping that the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of return for clients considering selling their home will 1) entice consumers towards the efficiency of their business, and 2) enable their real estate associates to quickly engage with potential clients based on model estimates. So our guiding questions were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which 5 are the top most influencing factors upon home price? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given data about these factors from the potential client's home, what will be the predicted selling price of their home?\n",

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "The data given for this project came from housing sales data from King County Washington for houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015.  Combining the information revealed from the dataset with industry relevant knowledge revealed a few categories of features which we thought would have an impact upon the sales price of the house. The sets we used, specifically included \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the data provided included the sales price and other information for around 21,000 houses sold between May 2014 and My 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overall map of the data:\n",

    "\n",
    "The distribution of prices looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Price Histogram](Images/price.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Categories\n",
    "#### **Location**, location, location\n",
    "What's the impact on the selling price if the home is in a top school district, in the Seattle metro area, or on the waterfront?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The **size** of the house in the fight...?\n",
    "What size datapoints most impact the sales price of the house? Bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, basement space, etc?\n",

    "...will your house be blown down? How effective can King County condition and grade values be in predicting the value of your home?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Limitations\n",
    "#### Date\n",
    "The sales data we used was from Maay 2014 - May 2015. This would prevent us from being able to see any longer term trends in the change of housing price between years. Additionally, this analysis did not account for inflation. Finally, we would have liked to have more recent data to assess any pattern or trends in sales price impact by current events (pandemics, protests, politics).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Simplicity\n",
    "The model goes for simplicity over predictive accuracy - so the model does not explain every variationin price. The business purpose is to enable people with limited information to get a general range, and allow the real estate firm to do the rest in terms of specifics. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price Range\n",
    "We limited the data for the model to houses above worth more than 100,000 USD and less than 1,000,000. Given the business being boutique and new in the market, the business goal was refined to be worth initial investments, but not beyond the expertise of associates new to the Seattle scene.                                            \n",

    "### Data Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, based on the business understanding and industry knowledge, we made several assumptions about the data in order to qualify the predictive accuracy of the model, including\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Renovations were total\n",
    "We assumed that homes marked as renovated by King County were total renovations - not just partial (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access to location data\n",
    "We assumed that the potential client would know the location of their home.\n",

    "\n",
    "![Great Location!](Images/seattle-2426307.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Home Size\n",

    "![Home Size](Images/sq_ft_living.png)\n",
    "\n",
