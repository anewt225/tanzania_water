    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Water in Africa: Techmnical and Equipment Researchers, LTD. (WATER) is a (hypothetical) consultancy which seeks to amplify the positive effects of progress in water point parts, supply, and maintenance. Progress may be made by the public and/or private sectors by analyzing, and anticipating the status of water point repair more quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting Water Point Maintenance Status from Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrumental goal in this project is to construct a model capable of predicting the status of a waterpoint (specifically, in Tanzania), between the three states of \"functional\", \"functional needs repair\", and \"non functioning\".The underlying motivation is to create a cheaply implemented, readily available tool for businesses or other organizations looking to provide maintenance and replacement services for said waterpoints. This should in principle lower the overhead costs for such providers (less chance of over-ordering parts, over-hiring staff, etc.) and so should, due to lower volatility and increased profitability, stimulate the creation of new providers or expansion of new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major factor in waterpoint failure is difficulty in accessing necessary maintenance; this model would help ameliorate that. In summary, our goal was:\n",

    "**Reduce overhead costs by anticipating water pump maintenance status.**\n",

    "### The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing additional context, we viewed several problems: several water points need work, maintenance was costly and infrequent, and water points would stay in states of disrepair because of these costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model helps to fix those problems by starting with more efficient market planning in determining resource distributions and repair/maintenance/parts necessities. Further, it should reduce volatility and increase profitability for maintenance providers. Finally, ideally it would increase the size of the pie by enabling more maintenance providers to enter the space"
